**Observation**:
* Reason for changes in presidential election eligibility criteria is to ensure that potential presidential candidate Tan Cheng Bock will not be elected.
* Tan Cheng Bock, like Ong Teng Cheong, is someone that will seek fulfill the true duty of President and seek accountability in the parliament's actions rather than just agree to all of PAP's actions.
* Presidents are just puppets chosen by the PAP.
* LHL is changing the eligibility criteria on the facade for racial representation but actually just wants to prevent Tan Cheng Bock from becoming president.

**Example Posts**:
* Yup spot onSmlj AAA rating all meaningless when one party rule can suka move goal posts.they are afraid people like ong teng cheong. so now choose president got to set new criteria, got to screen their personality ...scrutinize background.
* all these stunts are government just want to safe guard their president role " agenda behind is let someone WHO THEY FAMILIAR TO TAKE THE JOB AS PRESIDENT  thus work will be smooth , no conflicts "They claim is a " Must " to let minority to get elected..I was thinking " Let's say they cannot find any better ones from Malay, Indian , or even eurasian community " DON'T tell me they will " any how select one wiithin their cabinet to just fill up this million dollar tax payer job, role as President " ????In fact you go ask around, your malay friends , indians friends even eurasians ..they don't even give a Dam which race is the President.They more concerned about daily needs who care which race going to be president. Important is able to feed daily needs to feed our mouths.All these as usual is ciivl servants go create a job ....thus many departments , many civil servants have sometimes to do....zzzz
* Because TCB and OTC are vehicles for change, and while they are the presidents we NEED, they aren't the ones that certain people want.

**Observation**:
* Expressing dissatisfaction and anger for the rule that next elected President must be malay.
* Sarcastic comments about need for minority president.
* minority representation is a ploy by PAP to select someone of that will support them.

**Example Posts**:
* How about having a Thais or a Pinoy or PRC for a President? Why only pick a Malay this time? This Pee M once said - "Singapore is for all".
* Playing the race card is a red herring, what is important to the ruling elites is the elected president MUST be someone "ACCEPTABLE" (another word for ENDORSED) by them. Whatever changes made to the qualifying criteria for the elected president ensure this will be met politically.

**Observation**:
* Expressing dissatisfaction that election is a waste of time and tax money as it is ultimately not fair and manipulated by PAP.

**Example Posts**:
* the whole agenda is " They just want to abolish President election , thus get their own choice of president in "Simple as that full stop.I feel kinda waste of resources ...zzz lawyers debate here as usual ...civil servants etcoh wellnothing to do just find jobs ownself give oneself work to do lol
